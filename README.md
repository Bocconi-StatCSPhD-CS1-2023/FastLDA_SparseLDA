# FastLDA_SparseLDA
The goal of this project is to implement SparseLDA and FastLDA, two CPU-enhancing algorithms for Latent Dirichlet Allocation proposed by [[Yao et. al., 2009]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653450_Efficient_methods_for_topic_model_inference_on_streaming_document_collections) and [[Newman et. al., 2008]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221653277_Fast_collapsed_Gibbs_sampling_for_latent_Dirichlet_allocation). Details concerning the algorithms and my coding choices are discussed in the pdf file.
This README is a demo to show how the code should be run.
